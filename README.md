# Assistant

An AI assistant plugin for Obsidian that sends selected text to OpenAI's GPT API.

## Features
- Select text and send it to OpenAI's GPT API as a prompt
- The response is streamed into the editor after the selected text

## Getting Started
To get started with Assistant, you will need to add your OpenAI API key to the plugin's settings page. If you don't have an API key yet, you can obtain one from [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Privacy
Assistant respects your privacy. It only sends the text that you choose to OpenAI. Your data remains either stored locally on your device or is securely shared solely with OpenAI.

## Note
